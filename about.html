      <h1>ABOUT</h1>
        <p>Beeer is an all new way to keep track of the beers you've tried, and discover new ones. Our database of user reviewed beers is growing everyday and we'd love you to be a part of it. Whether you're just a beer fan or an avid taster, Beeer lets you keep track of, search and share, every detail of the brews you come across.</p> 
<p>At it's core, Beeer is a simply designed and yet uber detailed beer journal. What makes it different, is the community of Beeer users. Every time a beer is recorded it becomes part of the WallofBeeer.com, accessible to anyone. This growing list of reviews allows you to find out all about what other people are drinking and what they thought of it.</p>

      <div class="explanation"> 
      	<h1>EXPLANATION</h1>
        <p>WallofBeeer.com posts entries from the Beeer app. Beers that have only a single entry are simply posted to the wall. If it has more then one, the information is combined into an aggregate profile, which shows up with an orange border. Information that is opinion based, such as rating and taste, is averaged, while information that based on facts, such as style, is majority ruled. </p>
        <p>That's the basic functionality for now. Check back here in the future to see updates on features that we're working on. </p>

        <p>SPACE PIXEL IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS, CONTENT, INFORMATION, OR DATA OF THIRD PARTIES, AND YOU RELEASE US, OUR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS FROM ANY CLAIMS AND DAMAGES, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH ANY CLAIM YOU HAVE AGAINST ANY SUCH THIRD PARTIES.</p>
        <h2>Indemnification</h2>
        <p>You (and also any third party for whom you operate an account or activity on the Service) agree to defend (at Space Pixel's request), indemnify and hold the Space Pixel Parties harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with any of the following (including as a result of your direct activities on the Service or those conducted on your behalf): (i) your Content or your access to or use of the Service; (ii) your breach or alleged breach of these Terms of Use; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation, any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property or privacy right; (iv) your violation of any laws, rules, regulations, codes, statutes, ordinances or orders of any governmental and quasi-governmental authorities, including, without limitation, all regulatory, administrative and legislative authorities; or (v) any misrepresentation made by you.

As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local "small claims" court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor Space Pixel will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if Space Pixel is a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either Space Pixel or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use.</p>
        <p>You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Space Pixel can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Space Pixel in writing within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision. If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Space Pixel.</p>
        <h2>Limitation on Claims</h2>
        <p>You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with Space Pixel must be filed within six months after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.</p>
        <h2>Governing Law and Venue</h2>
        <p>These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law AND WILL SPECIFICALLY NOT BE GOVERNED BY THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS, IF OTHERWISE APPLICABLE. For any action at law or in equity relating to the arbitration provision of these Terms of Use, the Excluded Disputes or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, you agree to resolve any dispute you have with Space Pixel exclusively in a state or federal court located in Los Angeles, California, and to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Los Angeles County for the purpose of litigating all such disputes.</p>
        <p>If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Space Pixel's failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other term or condition. Space Pixel reserves the right to change this dispute resolution provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of the amendment. This dispute resolution provision will survive the termination of any or all of your transactions with Space Pixel.</p>
        <h2>Entire Agreement</h2>
        <p>If you are using the Service on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into an agreement on behalf of that legal entity. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and Space Pixel and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Space Pixel. You will not assign the Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of Space Pixel. Any purported assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent of Space Pixel will be null and void. Space Pixel may assign these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use remain in full force and effect. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act to modify the Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.</p>
        <h2>Territorial Restrictions</h2>
        <p>The information provided within the Service is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject Space Pixel to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. We reserve the right to limit the availability of the Service or any portion of the Service, to any person, geographic area, or jurisdiction, at any time and in our sole discretion, and to limit the quantities of any content, program, product, service or other feature that  provides.</p>
